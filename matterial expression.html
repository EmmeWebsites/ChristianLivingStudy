		<h1>Catholics</h1>
		<p>The Catholic Tradition believes in Transubstantiation. The bread and wine miracolously transform into the actual flesh and Blood of Jesus. 
		The Bread and wine isn't bread and wine anymore it has turned into the blood and body of Christ.</p>
		<p>Becuase the Bread and Wine had become the blood and body of Christ when Catholics eat it they must do so revently as what they are eating is very
		important.Â  </p>
		<p>Eating the bread and wine reminds and helps people in the Catholic Tradition acknowledge Christ's sacrifice.</p>

		<h1>Protestants </h1>
		<p>The Protestant Tradition believes that the bread and wine eaten during communion are just symbols that remind people of Jesus's sacrifice. 
		Similarly to Catholics the bread and wine in communion must be eaten with reverence and people must reflect and repent form their bad descisions 
		before they eat it. This is becuase the bread and WIne represents Jesus broken body and the cross and his blood from when he died on the cross to 
		save everyone. Becuase this is so important communion must be eaten respectfully.  </p>
