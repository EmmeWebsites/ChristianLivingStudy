		<h1>Catholics</h1>
		<p>The Catholic tradition believes that the ritual of baptism is essential for a person's salvation. They also believe that being baptised gives you 
		special graces in your life which is why they perform baptism to babies. Catholics believe there is a spiritual change in your sould once you are baptised 
		so you cannot be baptised more than once. </p>
		<p>Baptism is performed in the catholic tradition to cleanse someone of their original sin which is sin you are born with. The Catholic tradition has the belief that once you are baptised 
		you have entered the life of Christ and the Catholic Church but this change must be honoured and carried.  </p>

		<h1>Protestants </h1>
		<p>The Protestant tradition believes that it is a person's own choice when they want to be baptised. 
		<p> Protestants believe that baptism is just an outward symbolic act that signifies how they have repented and God has cleansed their sin. 
		Being baptised doesn't change anything about you it just shows others that you have acknowledged Godâ€™s forgiveness of their sins and their recognition
		that they can now be welcomed into the church. </p>
		<p> The Protestant tradition doesn't believe that baptism is needed for a person's salvation. However we still born with sin. </p>
