		<h1>Catholics</h1>
		<p>The Catholic ritual of baptism is often done to babies to cleanse them of their original sin. Parents consent for their child's baptsim.
		A priest pours water over the baby's head three times representing the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit who's power washes the 
		original sin. Chrism oil is then used to anoint the baby’s head in the shape of a cross by the baby’s
		parents and God parents to signify how the child has been filled with the Holy spirit. A white garment is then given to the baby to
		represent how they have been cleansed of their original sin. Adults can also participate in baptism. A Priest or Deacon must perform a 
		Catholic baptism. </p>

		<h1>Protestants </h1>
		<p>In the protestant ritual of baptism a person is fully submerged in the water. A person doesn't participate in the ritual of Baptism until they are 
		a teenager or adult as protestants believe that a person should make the choice themselves to be baptised. </p>
		<p>As the person enters the water it signifies them putting there old self behind them. As they are under the water it shows that God has cleaned them
		from there sin and as they emerge from the water they have committed to following a life Christ. 
        A baptism can be performed by a pastor or a significant person in the baptised person's walk with God. </p>
