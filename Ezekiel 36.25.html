		<h1>Maori</h1>
		<p>Narratives in the Maori tradition have passed down oraly for generations. The narratives of history as well as those explaining the 
		Maori Tradition's values and standards for behaviour can be told by waiata(songs), Whakataukī(proverbs), Pūrākau(stories), and the learning of 
		Tapu (Religious restrictions). Your identity is based on your Pepeha which describes a person's ancenstral history or Whakapapa, birth place, 
		family members and Tribe. </p>
		<p>These narratives have influenced Maori as Pepeha are performed as a way of intorucing yourself when you meet people and is also 
		done at the beginnings of hui, pōwhiri, and speeches. </p>

		<h1>Christian</h1>
		<p>Narratives in the Christian Tradition come mainly from the bible. It tells the history of God's people and gives examples and standards to the way 
		that his folowers in the Christian tradition should act.</p>
		<p> Through the bible God uses water to show cleansing and being made new into somethingg that God wants. Wee see this from when God floods the earth to 
		when John baptised people so they could be ready for Jesus. People in the Christian Tradition now are baptised because like in the bible it shows how they 
		have been made clean by God. </p>
